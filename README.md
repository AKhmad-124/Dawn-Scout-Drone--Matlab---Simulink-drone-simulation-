# Dawn Scout Drone (Matlab & Simulink drone simulation)
this a 2 phase project that i did over 4 month to boost my knowledge of flight controller and modeling
phase 1 :
I modeled a 3-DOF equation of motion then applied them to a drone that moves in 2D space then designed a postional controller for it made of 2 casscaded loop (inner for angular control and outer for postion cotrol)
all of this was made on Simulink and used Simscape multi body to visualize the motion no more
phase 2 :
I made simulation for a drone's motion in 3D space and a design for a position controller using Matlab , Simulink and Simscape multibody
I'm very proud of this achievement because that's one of the things i have been dreaming of doing ever since i got in collage in the field of aerospace engineering. looking forward to upgrading it and working on more fun projects like it

todo: 
improve propulsion system modeling / battery model
fix the yaw problem
make a better mixer
add some basic path following algorithem
have fun and color it
