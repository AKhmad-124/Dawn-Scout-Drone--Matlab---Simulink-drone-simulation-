# Dawn Scout Drone (Matlab & Simulink Drone Simulation)

## Project Description  
This a 2 phase project that I did over 4 months to boost my knowledge of flight controller and modeling.  

---

## Phase 1  
- I modeled a 3-DOF equation of motion then applied them to a drone that moves in 2D space.  
- Designed a positional controller made of 2 cascaded loops:  
  - Inner loop for angular control  
  - Outer loop for position control  
- All of this was made on Simulink and used Simscape Multibody to visualize the motion (no more).  

---

## Phase 2  
- I made simulation for a drone's motion in 3D space.  
- Designed a position controller using Matlab, Simulink and Simscape Multibody.

## Reflections  
I'm very proud of this achievement because that's one of the things I have been dreaming of doing ever since I got in college in the field of aerospace engineering. Looking forward to upgrading it and working on more fun projects like it.

## To-Do  
- Improve propulsion system modeling / battery model  
- Fix the yaw problem  
- Make a better mixer  
- Add some basic path following algorithm  
- Have fun and color it
